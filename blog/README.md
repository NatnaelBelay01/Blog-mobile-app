# Blog App

This is a **Blog App** built using **Flutter**, designed with **Clean Architecture** principles. The app allows users to view, create, update, and delete blog posts. It's modular, scalable, and follows best practices in state management and dependency injection.

## Features

- View blog posts
- Add new blog posts
- Edit existing blog posts
- Delete blog posts
- User authentication via **Supabase**
- Offline data storage using **Hive**
- State management with **BLoC**
- Support for multiple languages via **intl**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- Android SDK or iOS development tools
- A **Supabase** account (optional, for authentication)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd blog_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up API keys**:
   Configure your **Supabase** credentials in the project as necessary.

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Dependencies Used

- **BLoC**: For state management
- **Flutter Supabase**: For authentication and backend services
- **GetIt**: For dependency injection
- **Hive**: For offline data storage
- **Intl**: For internationalization and localization

## Offline Support

The app uses **Hive** for local data storage, allowing offline functionality. If the user is offline, data is retrieved from the local cache to ensure smooth operation.

## Dependency Injection

The app leverages **GetIt** for dependency injection, making it easier to manage dependencies like repositories and services across the app.

## Internationalization

Internationalization is handled using the **intl** package, allowing the app to support multiple languages.

## Testing

The app includes unit tests for the domain layer and widget tests for the presentation layer. Testing is crucial to ensuring the app works as expected.

### Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
flutter test
```
